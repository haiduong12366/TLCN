#introduce 
This project is focused on building a data lakehouse, which will help organizations store, manage, and analyze large amounts of data in an affordable, secure, and scalable way. The data lakehouse will act as a central storage space for all data, making it easy for users to access and query data from one place.

Minio will handle data storage, Delta Lake will manage data changes to ensure reliability, Spark will process large datasets for analysis, and Presto will enable fast SQL queries with Hive Metastore acting as a bridge. Finally, Superset will provide data visualization. This data lakehouse setup will make it easier for organizations to quickly access and analyze important data, supporting better data-driven decision-making.
